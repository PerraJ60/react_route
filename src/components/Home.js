          Lab #2:<br/> 
          For this lab, Products (see menu) is now implemented with a Tools web store, using a
          json server file.
          Global state management should be working. 
          Much is still not implemented, but it is a good platform to build further on.
          Changes in About, and Contact as well. Extern API, and styled components are used.
          Tests are done for 5 components, 4 of them are snapshots.
        </p>
      </h5>
    </div>
